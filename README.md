### About Me ðŸ‘‹

This is a test of the public repo in my profile system... 

If this had been an actual profile, you'd have been advised where to link
for information vital to your predicament. 

This is only a test.

I'm not clear whether the hyphens need to be in here to get it into "markdown" or what.
I guess I've got some learning to do for GitHub-wanna-be-LinkedIn-wanna-be-Facebook.

The universe is converging to "the notebook" while it is neither notes nor a book -- discuss.

But why is Docker trying to act exactly like GitHub? When I pop open K8s, is that going to have cells and repo too?

What is the plural of "repo"? It feels like it should be "repo" because the word ends in a vowel, like Latin... "repo'o" where you hit that "o" sound twice.

But enough about ME... What do YOU think about me? :emoji? ;-) Nope...

How do we get emojis from the keyboard here? Gitmoji? Not repo-moji. Remoji? Repoji? Emogit?
