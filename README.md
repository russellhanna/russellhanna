### About Me ðŸ‘‹

** This is a test of README-in-a-profile system... **

    (piercing audio...) This is only a test.

    If this had been an actual README, you'd have been advised where to link
    for information vital to your interests. 

This is only a test.}

I'm not clear why the example had the hyphens -- to get it into "markdown" or what?
I guess I've got some (more) learning to do for GitHub-wannabe-LinkedIn-wannabe-Facebook.
But, Docker???

DISCUSS: The universe is converging to "the notebook" while it is neither notes nor a book...talk amongst yourselves.

But why is Docker trying to act exactly like GitHub? When I start learning K8s, is that going to have cells and repo too?

What is the plural of "repo"? It feels like it should be "repo" because the word ends in a vowel, 
like Latin "Denarii" ...How about "repo'o" where you hit that "o" sound twice. (No. Not "re-poo." Very funny.)

But enough about ME... What do YOU think about me? :emoji? ;-) /giphy ? Aw nuts....

How do we get emojis from the keyboard here? Gitmoji? Not repo-moji. Remoji? Repoji? Emogit? :think :facepalm

I'm out. That's enough for a first pass.
